API/AJAX LAB
Task: Create a webpage that displays the posts from the AWW Subreddit.

Build Specifications
    1. Use JavaScript to request data from the https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/.json API.
    2. Display the results on the page.
    3. At a minimum, include a title, an image and a working link for each post. 
    (Easiest is to use the thumbnail for the image, but there are other images in 
    the JSON response.)
    4. Make it look good with some CSS.

Extended Challenges
    - Only show the first ten results.
    - Provide an input and button where the user can enter the name of a subreddit 
    to display instead of always aww.

Tests
    1. Displays multiple aww results, each including at least the title.
    2. Each post includes an image (if it has one).
    3. Each post includes a link to the post on the reddit website.
    4. At least 20 lines of CSS applied to spruce up the page.
